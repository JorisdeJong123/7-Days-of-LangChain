# 7 Days of LangChain
 Code repo for my "7 Days of LangChain" series. The repo is still quite messy, but I'll be fixing this the coming week.

# How to start?
Clone the repo or copy the code snippets you'd like to use.
Run 

<code>pip install -r requirements.txt to install required imports.</code>

# Want to know more about the code?
