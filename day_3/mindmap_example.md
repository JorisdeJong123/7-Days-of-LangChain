## Eight Things to Know about Large Language Models

### Main Topic 1: Predictability and Capabilities

- Subtopic 1: LLMs get more capable with increasing investment
    - Increasing investment leads to improved performance
    - Scaling laws allow for precise prediction of capabilities
    
- Subtopic 2: Unpredictable emergence of important behaviors
    - Specific behaviors can emerge unexpectedly with increasing investment
    - Models can fail at a task consistently, but a larger model may succeed
    
### Main Topic 2: Understanding and Interpretation

- Subtopic 1: LLMs learn and use representations of the outside world
    - Internal representations of color, objects, and geography
    - Ability to reason at an abstract level
    
- Subtopic 2: Lack of reliable techniques for steering LLM behavior
    - Limited control over LLM behavior
    - Challenges in interpreting and guiding LLMs
    
### Main Topic 3: Performance and Values

- Subtopic 1: LLM performance surpasses human performance
    - LLMs trained on more data can outperform humans
    - Additional training methods improve performance
    
- Subtopic 2: LLMs do not necessarily express the values of their creators or web text
    - Values expressed by LLMs can be controlled and influenced
    - Third-party input and oversight can shape LLM values
    
### Main Topic 4: Interaction and Misleading Behavior

- Subtopic 1: Brief interactions with LLMs can be misleading
    - Models can be sensitive to instructions and prompt wording
    - Contingent failures do not necessarily indicate lack of capability
